        <div class="projectDesc">
            The <strong>Stream Tool</strong> makes it possible for anyone with or without production
            experience to set up a competent tournament stream in no time, and it's meant to be used
            alongside streaming software like <i>OBS</i>.
            <br><br>
            Using the powerful features of <strong>Electron</strong> for the GUI, everything is built on
            a combination of vanilla <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
            <strong>Javascript</strong>, making an effort to use as few external libraries as possible
            to keep everything performant and lightweight.
            <br><br>
            This project is not only fully <strong>open-source</strong>, but built to be as customizable
            as possible, so everyone can modify it and give their own flavour to just about everything!
            <br><br>
            All Stream Tool versions are avaliable for both <i>Windows</i> and <i>Linux</i> with
            full feature parity.

        <div class="stDemoTitle">ABOUT ME</div>

        <div class="projectDesc">
            I first started programming on 2019, but it wasn't until Feb 2020 that I started learning javascript by myself
            mainly as a way to create programs that would help me with my stream work. It quickly became my main way of
            creating apps, becoming a web developer as I improved with each new project.
            <br><br>
            Most of the projects above are personal work, but to this day, I have done freelance work for a multitude of clients,
            including the developers of the games <i>Rivals of Aether</i> and <i>Rushdown Revolt</i>.
            <br><br>
