            Stream Tool

        <div class="projectDesc">
            The Stream Tool makes it possible for anyone with or without production experience
            to set up a tournament stream in no time, and it's meant to be used alongside streaming
            software like <i>OBS</i>.
            <br><br>
            Using the powerful features of Electron for the GUI, everything is built on the combination
            of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, making an effort to use as few external libraries as possible
            to keep everything performant and lightweight.
            <br><br>
            This project is not only fully open source, but built to be as customizable as possible,
            so everyone can modify it and give it their own flavour to just about everything!
            <br><br>
            All Stream Tool versions are avaliable for both <i>Windows</i> and <i>Linux</i> with
            full feature parity.

                features like 1v1 and 2v2 support, player/caster presets, Bo3/Bo5/BoX score modes,
                Winners/Losers indicators for Grand Finals, and many settings, the GUI

                A remote GUI can also be opened by any device within the local network to control
                your stream from anywhere, including mobile devices, thanks to using WebSockets and

        <div class="projectDesc">
            I first started programming on 2019, but it wasn't until Feb 2020 that I started learning javascript by myself
            mainly as a way to create programs that would help me with my stream work. It quickly became my main way of creating apps,
            becoming a web developer as I improved with each new project.

            <br><br>Most of my projects are personal work, but to this day, I have done freelance work for a multitude of clients,
            including the developers of the games <i>Rivals of Aether</i> and <i>Rushdown Revolt</i>.
