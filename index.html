            The Stream Tool makes it possible to set up a tournament stream in no time, meant to be used
            alongside streaming software like <i>OBS</i>. Written in pure
            Javascript and using Electron for the GUI, the Stream Tool is available for <a
                href="https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Stream-Tool"><i>Rivals of Aether</i></a>, where
            it's being constantly updated, and it's also available for other games like <a

                characters and their skins, round, casters, and more. Features include: Player presets, Best of 3/5
                modes,

            This web app uses a code used to share custom color skins from the game <i>Rivals of Aether</i>, and
            generates a
            transparent image that you can download and use wherever you want. It can also randomize said code to
            generate a custom skin, and you can also upload your own images to recolor them. You can try it out <a
